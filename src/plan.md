# Comprehensive Plan to Address Application Issues

## Plan:
1. **Login and Signup Enhancements**:
   - **`src/pages/LoginSignUp.jsx`**:
     - Implement email format validation and password strength checks.
     - Replace alert messages with a more user-friendly notification system (e.g., using a modal or toast notifications).
   - **`src/pages/Login.jsx`**:
     - Implement actual authentication logic (e.g., API call to validate user credentials).
     - Replace alert messages with a more user-friendly notification system.

2. **Home Page Adjustments**:
   - **`src/pages/Home.jsx`**:
     - Uncomment the `ProductList` component to ensure products are displayed on the home page.
     - Ensure that the `searchQuery` prop is correctly passed to the `ProductList` component for filtering products.

3. **App Structure Review**:
   - **`src/App.jsx`**:
     - Review the routing paths to determine if the `/RawHerb/` prefix is necessary. If not, adjust the paths accordingly.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Test the application after making the changes to ensure that the login, signup, and home page functionalities work as expected.
- Verify that user feedback is clear and helpful.
- Ensure that the application is responsive and user-friendly.
